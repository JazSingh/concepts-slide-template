Now that we are familiar with Scala...

. . .

lets look at an awesome library implemented in Scala.

. . .

Lightweight Modular Staging (LMS)

---

#LMS is..

'A library-based multi-stage programming approach that uses types to distinguish between binding time.'

#A gentle introduction to LMS

##Power function in Scala

```Scala
def power(b: Double, x: Int): Double =
  if (x == 0) 1.0 else b * power(b, x - 1)
```

##Power function in Scala LMS

```Scala
trait PowerA { this: Arith =>
  def power(b: Rep[Double], x: Int): Rep[Double] =
    if (x == 0) 1.0 else b * power(b, x - 1)
}
```

---

#A gentle introduction to LMS

##What did we just see?

* ```T``` versus ```Rep[T]```
* ```def``` versus  ```trait```

---

#Productivity vs Performance

## Software performance depends more on programmer productivity
* Processor clock speed doesn't double every 18 months
* High-level programming is hard to translate to efficient code 
* Shift towards big data workloads

## Result: Hand-optimized programs (BAD IDEA)
* abandoning all best practices and benefits of high-level programming
* programs become hard to read, maintain, verify...
* this attracts bugs and security vulnerabilities

---

#Solution: Generative Programming

## Write a program generator
* Produces the code of a program as output
* Reorganization of a programs' execution into stages, also called multi-stage programming

---

# How do we write MSP-programs?
* A single-stage program is developed, implemented and tested
* Ensure the the program can be used in a staged manner. Otherwise "refactor"
* Introduce staging annotations

---

# Another stage!
## From 
* Compilation-based program execution:
* Compile-time, run-time.

## To
* Generated program execution:
* Generation-time, Compile-time, run-time.

#How to LMS:

* Staging
* Generating code
* Data types

#How to LMS: Simple staging

##Power function in Scala:
```Scala
def power(b: Double, p: Int): Double = {
  if (p == 0) 
    1.0 
  else 
    b * power(b, p - 1)
}
```

---

#How to LMS: Simple staging

##Staged power function in LMS:
```Scala
def power(b: Rep[Double], p: Int): Rep[Double] = {
  if (p == 0) 
    1.0 
  else 
    b * power(b, p - 1)
}
```

. . .

```Scala
power(b, 3)
```

---

#How to LMS: Simple staging

```Scala
power(b, 3)
```

##Generated code:
```Scala
def apply(x3: Double): Double = {
  val x4 = x3 * x3
  val x5 = x3 * x4
  x5
}
```

---

#How to LMS: Staging with recursion

##Simple factorial function
```Scala
def fac(n: Rep[Int]): Rep[Int] = {
  if (n == 0) 1
  else n * fac(n - 1)
}
```

. . .

```Scala
fac(n)
```

. . .

```Scala
...
[error] (run-main) java.lang.StackOverflowError
[error] (compile:run) Nonzero exit code: 1
...
```

---

#How to LMS: Staging with recursion

```Scala
power(b, 3)    vs.   fac(n)
```

. . .

Make use of a lambda function:

```Scala
def fac: Rep[Int => Int] = doLambda { n => 
  if (n == 0) 1
  else n * fac(n-1)
}
```

Now we can try it again:
```Scala
fac(n)
```

---

#How to LMS: Staging with recursion

##Generated code
```Scala
def apply(x12:Int): Int = {
  var x1 = {x2: (Int) =>
    val x3 = x2 == 0
    val x8 = if (x3) { 1 }
    else { 
      val x4 = x2 - 1
      val x5 = x1(x4)       // recursion
      val x6 = x2 * x5
      x6 }
    x8: Int }
  val x13 = x1(x12)         // recursion
  x13 }
```

---

#How to LMS: Generating code

```Scala
power(b, 3)
```

##Generated code:
```Scala
def apply(x3: Double): Double = {
  val x4 = x3 * x3
  val x5 = x3 * x4
  x5
}
```

---

#How to LMS: Generating code

##Optimized power function
```Scala
def powerOpt(b: Rep[Double], p: Int): Rep[Double] = {
  def loop(x: Rep[Double], ac: Rep[Double], 
                           y: Int): Rep[Double] = 
    if (y == 0)
      ac
    else if (y % 2 == 0)
      loop(x * x, ac, y / 2)
    else
      loop(x, ac * x, y - 1)

  loop(b, 1.0, p)
}
```

---

#How to LMS: Generating code

```Scala
powerOpt(b, 3)
```

##Generated code:
```Scala
def apply(x3: Double): Double = {
  val x4 = x3 * x3
  val x5 = x3 * x4
  x5
}
```

. . .

LMS can generate the same code from different staged codes.

---

#How to LMS: Generating code

But not per se.

. . .

For example:
```Scala
powerOpt(b, 6)
```

. . .

##Generated code of optimized version
```Scala
def apply(x4:Double): Double = {
  val x5 = x4 * x4
  val x6 = x5 * x5
  val x7 = x5 * x6
  x7
}
```

---

#How to LMS: Generated code

##Trivial regular expression

```Scala
checkRegex(".", "Hello world")
```

The char '.' is a wildcard in Scala.

---

#How to LMS: Generated code

##Partial regex code

```Scala
def matchStar(...): Rep[Boolean] = { ... }
def matchBegin(...): Rep[Boolean] = { ... }
def matchEnd(...): Rep[Boolean] = { ... }
```

```Scala
def matchChar(c: Char, t: Rep[Char]): Rep[Boolean] =
{ c == '.' || c == t }
```

. . .

Now do:
```Scala
checkRegex(".", s)
```

---

#How to LMS: Generated code

```Scala
...
val x47 = while ({ val x28 = x27
  val x34 = if (x28) { false }
  else { val x30 = x26
    val x32 = x30 < x31
    x32 } x34}) {
  val x36 = x26 += 1
  val x37 = x26
  val x38 = x37 < x31
  val x42 = if (x38) {
    val x39 = x25(x37)
    val x40 = '.' == x39   // matchChar(...)
    val x41 = true || x40  // c == '.' || c == t
    x41 }
  else { false }
...
```

---

#How to LMS: Generated code

Generated code is not meant to be human-readable

---

#How to LMS: Data types

The previous examples only considered:

* Rep[Int]
* Rep[Double]
* Rep[Char]
* Rep[Boolean]

. . .

But what to do for datatypes that are of your own making?
